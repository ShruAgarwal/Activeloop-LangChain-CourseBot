## How to use ðŸ‘€

1. Enter your OpenAI API key.
   - You can get your own OpenAI API key from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and then click on the `+ Create new secret key` button.
2. You can now proceed to ask questions related to the course to the chatbot.

## Behind the Scenes âš™
This educational chatbot demonstrates the power of **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** to answer queries related to the course and provides relevant info to you by retrieving data from an extensive and detailed knowledge base. It returns a natural response to your questions along with the truth source.

*Here's a summary of the scripts used for building this chatbot:*

1. `data_loading.py`:
   - Handles the initial data gathering and processing task where it scrapes the text data from the Langchain course website using **[Apify](https://apify.com/)**.
   - The scraped text data is then converted into numerical form (vectors) using [`CohereEmbeddings`](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/embeddings) that the chatbot can learn from.
   - Finally, the transformed data is uploaded to **[Deep Lake](https://docs.activeloop.ai/)**, a data storage service, for future use.

2. `app_workflow.py`:
   - Handles the retrieval and ranking of the relevant data.
   - First, it gathers the stored data from the `data_loading.py` file.
   - Second, it uses `CohereRerank` to rank and retrieve the most relevant data based on the userâ€™s query.
      - `CohereRerank` is a reranking service that refines and ranks documents in alignment with a userâ€™s search criteria.
   - Third, it also builds the conversation chain with memory, which helps in maintaining the context of the conversation.

3. `app_demo.py`:
   - The main script demonstrates the working of the chatbot through a user-friendly web interface using **Streamlit**.
   - The chatbot then uses the stored and transformed data from **Deep Lake** to answer user queries.
